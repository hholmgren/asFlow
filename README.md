asFlow
======

Asynchronous flow control library for JavaScript and Nodejs.

These functions are based on <a href="http://book.mixu.net/ch7.html">Mixu's Node Book chapter 7. Control flow</a>. They sure can be optimized and this readme file needs to be more thorough. This repository contains asFlow.js for use on clients, a node module and files for testing. 

What I wanted with this library was to make easy to understand functions that control three types of asynchronous flow and only these three. Please feel free to make them faster and more reliable but keep them as readable as possible. My goal is for users new to these functions, to be able to use them without ever reading the Readme.md ...
